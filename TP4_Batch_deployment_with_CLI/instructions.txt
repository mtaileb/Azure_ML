# Create compute cluster:
# Batch endpoints run on compute clusters. They support both Azure Machine Learning
# Compute clusters (AmlCompute) or Kubernetes clusters. Clusters are a shared resource
# so one cluster can host one or many batch deployments (along with other workloads if desired).

# Create a batch endpoint:
# A batch endpoint is an HTTPS endpoint that clients can call to trigger a batch scoring job
