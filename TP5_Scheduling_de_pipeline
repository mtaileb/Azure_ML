Trois possibilités:
1- Via l'UI de Studio

2- Via Azure CLI:
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/schedule.schema.json
name: simple_recurrence_job_schedule
display_name: Simple recurrence job schedule
description: a simple hourly recurrence job schedule

trigger:
  type: recurrence
  frequency: day #can be minute, hour, day, week, month
  interval: 1 #every day
  schedule:
    hours: [4,5,10,11,12]
    minutes: [0,30]
  start_time: "2022-07-10T10:00:00" # optional - default will be schedule creation time
  time_zone: "Pacific Standard Time" # optional - default will be UTC

create_job: ./simple-pipeline-job.yml
# create_job: azureml:simple-pipeline-job

3- Via SDK Python (3.10 v2):
schedule_name = "simple_sdk_create_schedule_recurrence"

schedule_start_time = datetime.utcnow()
recurrence_trigger = RecurrenceTrigger(
    frequency="day",
    interval=1,
    schedule=RecurrencePattern(hours=10, minutes=[0, 1]),
    start_time=schedule_start_time,
    time_zone=TimeZone.UTC,
)

job_schedule = JobSchedule(
    name=schedule_name, trigger=recurrence_trigger, create_job=pipeline_job
)

Expication des propriétés ci-dessus:

    (Required) To provide better coding experience, we use RecurrenceTrigger for recurrence schedule.


    (Required) frequency specifies the unit of time that describes how often the schedule fires. Can be minute, hour, day, week, month.

    (Required) interval specifies how often the schedule fires based on the frequency, which is the number of time units to wait until the schedule fires again.

    (Optional) schedule defines the recurrence pattern, containing hours, minutes, and weekdays.
        When frequency is day, pattern can specify hours and minutes.
        When frequency is week and month, pattern can specify hours, minutes and weekdays.
        hours should be an integer or a list, from 0 to 23.
        minutes should be an integer or a list, from 0 to 59.
        weekdays can be a string or list from monday to sunday.
        If schedule is omitted, the job(s) will be triggered according to the logic of start_time, frequency and interval.

    (Optional) start_time describes the start date and time with timezone. If start_time is omitted, start_time will be equal to the job created time. If the start time is in the past, the first job will run at the next calculated run time.

    (Optional) end_time describes the end date and time with timezone. If end_time is omitted, the schedule will continue trigger jobs until the schedule is manually disabled.

    (Optional) time_zone specifies the time zone of the recurrence. If omitted, by default is UTC. To learn more about timezone values, see appendix for timezone values (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-schedule?view=azureml-api-2#appendix).
